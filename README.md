## Overview

My resume using the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template. I have made some modifications to the
template to fit my needs. I added a run script which creates the LaTeX environment in a docker container and then
generates the resume.

## How to Run

The following command will generate the resume in a docker container.

```bash run.sh```
